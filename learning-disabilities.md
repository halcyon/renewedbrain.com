Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a widely used term in
schools and homes to describe people who have problems paying
attention. However, ADHD is a condition that includes more than just
paying attention. The area of that is affected by ADHD is responsible for everything 
from planning, organizing, judgment and decision making, which are all problematic
for the person who has ADHD.

Common complaints parents make about their children who may have ADHD are:

* Not listening and complaining of forgetfulness
* Problems starting and finishing tasks
* Taking a long time to complete a task
* Needing outside structure such as frequent prompting to stay on task
* Organizing materials and forgetting books and homework
* Lack of motivation to do chores or uninteresting things
* Not being able to follow multi-step directions
* Over-talkativeness and excessive energy
* Impulsivity
* Irritability and argumentativeness
* Problems with messiness in their rooms and with their personal belongings

Parents may wonder if their teens are “lazy,” rebellious,
disrespectful, or if they have a problem processing information. In
general, most kids really want to do their best, and what may appear
as laziness or apathy, may be the teen’s reaction to being frustrated
in their overall performance. Individuals with these issues often
suffer from low self-esteem, because it seems that the harder they try,
the less they get accomplished. Depression and anxiety often accompany
ADHD and other learning problems, as the person does not feel able to
overcome their learning challenges.

ADHD and learning disabilities cannot be diagnosed with a simple
behavior checklist or a one hour interview with a psychologist or
psychiatrist. ADHD in particular can mimic other disorders, such as
depression and anxiety, or behavioral disorders. Thorough testing has
to be conducted to determine if the person really has ADHD, to what
degree, and what areas of functioning are affected. In addition, other
learning disabilities, such as reading, math, or auditory processing
problems, co-occur in 70% of the individuals who have ADHD.  It is
important to determine where the thinking process is inefficient so
that the right course of treatment can be recommended. Stimulant
medications help only individuals who truly have ADHD, and they
generally increase the ability to focus. However, they do not "fix"
other issues in executive functions, such as planning and decision making. 
Strategies often need to be learned to help the person work around their weak areas, which vary 
depending on the individual. Testing is crucial in identifying a person’s strengths, as
well as their weaknesses, so that they may learn skills in order to
succeed in school and in life. If the problem is not ADHD, but anxiety
or depression, different medications and treatment options would be
recommended. In the case of other learning disorders, stimulant medications would not be 
useful, but tutoring and cognitive rehabilitation in  areas of weakness can make a huge impact.

If you or your teen has a learning problem, the information you would
learn through testing and cognitive rehabilitation would be invaluable
to you in terms of ensuring success. Even if your child has been
tested in elementary school, their brains have developed more since then and 
changes have likely occurred. Re-testing in middle school and high school is important to document 
new areas of strength and weakness. For teens and college students, such testing is required in
order to gain assistance from college Learning Centers. The
Board of Regents states on their web site what documentation is required 
for a college student to receive additional time for tests, tutoring, and
other accommodations needed to optimize learning. Testing must be
current (within 3 years) to obtain Learning Center services. For more information on
