Dr. Lacy offers a variety of assessments for a wide range of problems.  Her primary specialty is in neuropsychology, the study of the relationship between the brain and behavior. Conditions that would fall under the category of neuropsychology include: brain injury, stroke, tumors, seizures, hydrocephalus, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, learning disabilities, ADHD, and other neurological conditions.  

Services provided include neuropsychological testing, education, cognitive rehabilitation to improve thinking skills, and therapy.

Psychological testing is offered for a variety of situations including “fitness for duty” evaluations, military evaluations, adoptions, and personality assessments as an adjunct to psychotherapy.  Individuals can be referred by other psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, physicians, adoption agencies, or employment agencies for psychological testing.

Dr. Lacy strives to provide accurate and objective assessments of brain disorders and practical recommendations to help patients receive the best treatment possible. Communicating with all members of the patient’s support system is important, including treating physicians and case managers, in order to provide the best care.  

Dr. Lacy also provides evalyations and brief psychotherapy for patients who have chronic pain.  Patients with chronic headaches, back pain, orthopedic pain, and nerve pain can receive brief therapy to learn pain management techniques.  Though your pain is real and physical, psychological factors play a key role in your tolerance for pain and level of daily functioning.  Psychological testing is also provided as part of the pre-surgical screening for spinal cord stimulators and intrathecal morphine pumps.
