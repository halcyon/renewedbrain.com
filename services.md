Dr. Lacy strives to provide accurate and objective assessments, as well as practical recommendations to help patients receive the best treatment possible.

NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS AND TREATMENT: Dr. Lacy offers a variety of assessments for a wide range of problems.  Her primary specialty is in neuropsychology, the study of the relationship between the brain and behavior. Conditions that would fall under the category of neuropsychology include: brain injury, stroke, tumors, seizures, hydrocephalus, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, learning disabilities, ADHD, dementia, and other neurological conditions.  Services provided include neuropsychological testing, education, and cognitive rehabilitation to improve thinking skills.
 
FAA EVALS: Dr. Lacy is an Aerospace Neuropsychologist and has completed training through the HIMS program. Pilots are often referred by the FAA for neuropsychological testing for special issuance of medical certificates. Dr. Lacy is trained in Cogscreen-AE administration and interpretation. Evaluations may range from a simple interview and Cogscreen-AE evaluation to a full neuropsychological battery, depending on the requirements established by the FAA.  All FAA referrals, including evaluations for the HIMS treatment program, are accepted. 

NFL EVALS: Baseline Assessment Program (BAP) neuropsychological assessments for retired NFL players that are part of the NFL Concussion Settlement are provided by Dr. Lacy.  She is an approved provider through the Baseline Assessment Program. The BAP manages scheduling the neuropsychological assessment in these cases. 

PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS: Psychological testing is also offered, including “fitness for duty” evaluations, military evaluations, adoptions, and personality assessments as an adjunct to psychotherapy.  Individuals can be referred by other psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, physicians, adoption agencies, or employment agencies for psychological testing.

PRE-SURGICAL EVALUATIONS: Chronic pain evaluations and brief psychotherapy are offered for patients who are seeking surgical interventions for pain relief.  Patients with chronic headaches, back pain, orthopedic pain, and nerve pain can receive brief therapy to learn pain management techniques.  Though a person's pain is real and physical, psychological factors play a key role in pain tolerance and level of daily functioning.  Psychological testing is provided as part of the pre-surgical screening required by insurance companies for spinal cord stimulators and intrathecal morphine pumps.

THERAPY: Therapy services include traditional psychotherapy for mood disorders and life challenges, as well as cognitive rehabilitation, chronic pain management, and PTSD approaches for accident, work related, or military PTSD. Dr. Lacy carries a limited case load and employs additional therapists to address the needs of patients. Your first appointment is with Dr. Lacy to determine what kind of therapy would best suit your needs. We are proud to serve military personnel, veterans, healthcare workers, and first responders.

TELEMENTAL HEALTH: We offer online therapy sessions, for insurance plans that cover such services and for self pay patients, upon request.
