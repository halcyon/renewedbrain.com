Brain injury can occur during an automobile accident, work related
accident, military combat, sports concussion, or any kind of trauma to the
head. When brain injuries occur because of an
outside force, it is often referred to as Traumatic Brain
Injury. Brain injuries also result from events such as strokes,
aneurysms, seizures, cancer or tumor, brain surgery, hydrocephalus,
infections, toxic exposure, substance abuse, and lack of oxygen to the brain.
These types of events are usually referred to as Acquired Brain Injuries.

Brain injuries affect people in various ways, depending on the
location and severity of the injury. A patient may or may not have
lost consciousness or been in a coma, but there can be a significant
change in a person’s thinking skills and personality after suffering a
brain injury. Changes in thinking and daily functioning are often
noted by the patient’s family and friends, even if the patient does
not recognize any problems with their thinking.

Common symptoms of brain injury include problems with:

* memory

* attention and concentration

* speech or language skills 

* reading, math, or academics 

* decision making and problem solving 

* motivation and initiation

* low tolerance for frustration with anger outbursts

* depression, anxiety and other changes in mood 

* changes in personality

* headaches and seizures

* changes in sleeping and eating habits


It is critical to have brain injuries evaluated through
neuropsychological testing.   The brain usually does not heal 100%, 
and we cannot determine to what extent the brain will heal itself,
or which problems will remain in any given individual. The brain 
usually does the most healing in the first two years after injury. 
That is the time to begin cognitive rehabilitation in order to 
learn new ways of doing things. Testing identifies those areas of thinking 
that need treatment. Neuropsychological testing is often
recommended sometime within the first 6 months after injury (if
possible), and then is repeated at the 1 year and 2 year marks to
document the patient’s progress and remaining areas of difficulty.

Testing also helps determine if a person is able to return to work or school, 
and identify any accomodations that need to be in place to help them succeed. 
In the case of learning disabilities, the person may have
struggled with problems in thinking most of their life. 
Neuropsychological testing is required in schools and colleges to receive 
learning assistance for learning disabilities and ADHD.

### What is neuropsychological testing?

Neuropsychology is the study of the relationship between the brain and
behavior. Testing helps us to understand how the brain is functioning. CT and MRI scans usually 
can identify if there structural changes in the brain, and are usually
ordered by a neurologist, Such scans cannot describe how well a person's brain is
functioning. Neuropsychological evaluations are pencil and paper tasks or computer 
programs that challenge a person’s abilities in all areas of thinking. Neuropsychological testing 
is more thorough than psychological or even psychoeducational testing in that it goes beyond assessing
personality, intelligence and academic functioning to include all areas of cognitive functioning.

### Is neuropsychological testing right for you?

We often receive calls from people stating they have been diagnosed with four or five different diagnose, and 
they are confused as to the cause of their problems and how to treat them. Neuropsychological testing helps to determine if 
the problem is related to injuries or diseases of the brain, medication side effects, medical problems, chronic pain factors, or emotional
issues. Testing is for anyone who believes that they have a problem in their thinking and want to learn more information about the underlying cause and possible treatment options. You do not need a referral for neuropsychological testing, unless your insurance requires it. Patients are often referred by their neurologist, family physician, psychiatrist, rehabilitation specialists, lawyer, Workers’ Compensation case manager, or school psychologist. 

### What does neuropsychological testing involve?

Testing usually takes 4-6 hours, sometimes more, depending on the issue. The first hour is
an interview with the patient and any family members that may be able
to provide additional information about the patient’s history. You
will be asked extensive questions about your symptoms, medical history, psychiatric and 
social history. The remainder of the day will be spent testing the various functions of
the brain through different kinds of tasks to see how well you
perform. Once testing is completed, the tests are scored, interpreted,
combined with any available medical records, and integrated into a detailed report that can be shared 
with any of your physicians or your school. Feedback sessions are provided usually two 
weeks after testing.
