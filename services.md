Dr. Lacy offers a variety of assessments for a wide range of problems. 
Her primary specialty is in Neuropsychology, the study of the
relationship between the brain and behavior. Conditions that would
fall under the category of neuropsychology include: brain injury,
stroke, tumors, seizures, hydrocephalus, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s,
learning disabilities, ADHD, and other neurological conditions. 
Services provided include neuropsychological testing (please see Brain
Injury page for a description), education, cognitive rehabilitation to improve 
thinking skills, and therapy to improve one's adjustment to their condition.

A secondary specialty is Chronic Pain.  People with
chronic headaches, back pain, orthopedic pain, and nerve pain can
receive brief therapy to learn pain management techniques.  Though your pain
is real and physical, psychological factors play a key role in
increasing your tolerance for pain and improving daily functioning.  
Psychological testing is also provided as part of the pre-surgical screening 
for spinal cord stimulators and intrathecal morphine pumps.

Psychological testing is offered for a variety of situations including
"fitness for duty" evaluations, military evaluations, adoptions, and
personality assessments as an adjunct to psychotherapy.  Individuals can
be referred by other psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors,
physicians, adoption agencies, or employment agencies for
psychological testing.

Dr. Lacy strives to provide accurate and objective assessments of
brain disorders with practical recommendations so that the patient
receives the best possible treatment to meet their needs. Dr. Lacy
believes in working with all members of the patient's support system
to work toward maximizing an individual's level of independence, including 
collaborating with treating physicians and case managers.
