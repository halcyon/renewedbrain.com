Brief and long term therapy are offered for issues including life transistions, stress management, anxiety and depression, grief, chronic medical conditions, and cognitive rehabilitation. Dr. Lacy has a limited case load and tends to see patients for short term therapy. Long term therapy is offered by others in the clinic. Depending on your needs, you may see one of our wonderful therapists instead of Dr. Lacy. Your first appointment is with Dr. Lacy to determine what kind of therapy and which therapist would best suit your needs.
