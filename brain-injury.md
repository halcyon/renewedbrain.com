Brain injury can occur during an automobile accident, work related
accident, military combat, electrocution, sports concussion, or any kind of trauma to the
head. When brain injuries occur because of an
outside force, it is often referred to as Traumatic Brain
Injury. Brain injuries also result from events such as strokes,
aneurysms, seizures, cancer or tumor, brain surgery, hydrocephalus,
encephalopathies (infections or metabolic imbalances that affect the
brain), and lack of oxygen to the brain during surgery. Also, substance abuse, 
medication overdoses or severe adverse side effects, and toxic exposure to chemicals 
can cause brain injury. These types of events are usually referred to as Acquired Brain Injuries.

Brain injuries affect people in various ways, depending on the
location and severity of the injury. A patient may or may not have
been in a coma or lost consciousness, but there can be a significant
change in a person’s thinking skills and personality after suffering a
brain injury. Changes in thinking and daily functioning are often
noted by the patient’s family and friends, even if the patient does
not recognize any problems with their thinking. Common symptoms of
brain injury include decreases in memory, attention, concentration,
speech or language skills, reading, math, naming of objects, word
finding, making decisions, solving problems, motivation, initiation,
tolerance for frustration, and anger control. Also, psychiatric
symptoms often result from brain injury, most commonly depression and anxiety. 
Sometimes headaches and seizures accompany brain injuries.

It is critical to have brain injuries evaluated through
neuropsychological testing. The brain usually does the most healing in the first 
two years after injury.  That is the time period to begin using cognitive rehabilitation 
in order to learn new ways of doing things. Testing identifies those areas of thinking that
need treatment. The brain usually does not heal 100%, but we cannot determine to what extent 
the brain will heal itself or which problems will remain. Those things vary widely from person to
person. We do know that cognitive rehabilitation, which is therapy
aimed at teaching someone how to compensate for their limitations, has
the most powerful impact when provided during the first two years
after the brain injury. Neuropsychological testing is often
recommended sometime within the first 6 months after injury (if
possible), and then is repeated at the 1 year and 2 year marks to
document the patient’s progress and remaining areas of difficulty.

Testing also helps determine if a person has the cognitive or thinking
skills needed to return to work or school. If it is determined that a
person can work, but cannot return to their previous job,
recommendations can be made for the type of environment in which a
person would work best. Recommendations are also made for the person
who wishes to return to school or college. This testing is required in
schools and colleges to get learning assistance for learning disabilities and ADHD.

### What is neuropsychological testing?

Neuropsychology is the study of the relationship between the brain and
behavior. Testing involves understanding how a healthy or an unhealthy
brain is functioning. CT scans and MRIs usually can identify if there
is something that has structurally changed in the brain, such as a
significant injury, stroke, tumor, etc. However, these tests, usually
performed by a neurologist, cannot tell a person how well their brain is
working. Neuropsychological evaluations are pencil and paper tasks or computer 
programs that challenge a person’s abilities in all areas of thinking,
including attention, planning, organization, problem solving, memory,
drawing processing, and other cognitive skills. Neuropsychological testing 
is more thorough than psychological or even psychoeducational testing in that it goes beyond assessing
personality, intelligence and academic functioning to include all areas of functioning.

### Is neuropsychological testing right for you?

"I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a personality disorder,
attention deficit, post-traumatic stress disorder, OCD, depression and
anxiety. I want to know what is the real problem?"

Neuropsychological testing is for anyone who believes they have a
change or problem in their thinking and want to know what the likely cause is
and how to treat it. Often a person is referred by their neurologist for testing. 
However, some people are referred by their general physician, psychiatrist,
rehabilitation specialists, lawyer, Workers’ Compensation case
manager, or school psychologist. Not all patients have had an injury
or illness. In the case of learning disabilities, the person may have
struggled with problems in thinking most of their life. If you have a concern 
about your daily functioning, ability to work, progress in school, or have any problems
in your thinking or emotions, then neuropsychological testing may be
the service you need to answer your questions and provide a direction for treatment.

### What does neuropsychological testing involve?

Testing can take 1-2 days depending on the problem. The first hour is
an interview with the patient and any family members that may be able
to provide additional information about the patient’s history. You
will be asked questions about your injury, illness or learning
problem, as well as questions about your mood, daily activities,
medical history, medications, education, work, and social history. The
remainder of the day will be spent testing the various functions of
the brain through different kinds of tasks to see how well you
perform. Once testing is completed, the tests are scored, interpreted,
and a detailed report is written that can be shared with any of your
physicians or with your school. Feedback sessions are provided usually two 
weeks after testing, so that medical records can be reviewed and combined with
test results for interpretation.
