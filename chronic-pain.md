Your pain is not in your head. You did not want this experience and you would do anything to reduce the pain. Your pain management physician offers you the option of a spinal cord stimulator or morphine pain pump. So, why do you need to see a psychologist?

Insurance companies usually require a psychological evaluation prior to surgery, just as they do for gastric bypass surgery. These kinds of surgeries are expensive and research has shown that their success or failure rate depends heavily on psychological factors. We want to be sure that you have the best chance of a successful outcome. That means identifying any psychological barriers to successful pain management treatment. Results of the evaluation help determine if psychotherapy or a psychiatric consultation for medication is needed prior to having surgery. 

When patients do not pass their psychological evaluation, recommendations are made for further treatment. Some patients only need a brief course of therapy that involves teaching relaxation and pain management coping skills. The basic skills can be taught in 10 sessions or less. Depending on availability, patients are welcome to return for a brief course in pain management, though a list of other providers are also provided. Some patients will require more extensive psychotherapy and will be referred to outside providers.
