As we age, our thinking skills gradually diminish and we realize that we are not
as mentally sharp as we once were. The question arises if we need to be 
concerned about dementia. There are a number of different kinds of dementia, 
or what people used to call "senility". Dementia is a disease of the central
nervous system that reduces brain functioning gradually over time. 

Dementias include:

* Alzheimer's 
* Vascular Dementia 
* Frontotemporal Dementia
* Parkinson’s 
* Lewy Body 
* HIV/ AIDS Related Dementia
* and other degenerative diseases of the brain. 

The most familiar type of dementia is Alzheimer’s dementia. The main characteristic of 
Alzheimer’s is gradual loss of short term memory, but other things can also be
affected. The person can have problems making decisions, paying bills,
finding their way around, recalling names, finding the right word to
say, controlling or showing emotions, or remembering how to do
things. Often the early signs of dementia look like depression or anxiety, which can also mimic dementia. 
It is important to diagnose dementia early because there are helpful treatments that can improve 
daily functioning, though there is no way to slow the progression of the disease or to cure it. 

Some patients do not yet have dementia, but are diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
Individuals with MCI have a decrease in one or more areas of thinking, but the decrease is 
not significant enough to be diagnosed as a dementia. This is a critical time to diagnose
problems with thinking and memory, because it is currently believed
that the earlier a person receives treatment, the better the chance
that the patient will remain independent for a longer period of time.
If you have concerns that your thinking skills are not as good as they once were,
and you are worried that the changes are not just a part of normal
aging, then you may want to ask us about neuropsychological
testing. If you would like to set an appointment contact our office.
