Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a widely used term in to describe people who have problems paying
attention. However, ADHD is a condition that includes more than just paying attention. 
The area of the brain that is affected by ADHD is responsible for everything 
from planning, organizing, prioritizing, judgment, and decision making, which are all problematic
for the person who has ADHD.

Common complaints parents make about their children who may have ADHD are:

* Not listening and complaining of forgetfulness
* Problems starting and finishing tasks
* Taking a long time to complete a task
* Needing outside structure such as frequent prompting to stay on task
* Poor organization of materials and forgetting books and homework
* Lack of motivation to do chores or uninteresting tasks
* Not able to follow multi-step directions
* Over-talkativeness and excessive energy
* Impulsivity
* Irritability and argumentativeness
* Messy rooms 

Parents may wonder if their teens are “lazy,” rebellious,
disrespectful, or if they have a problem processing information. In
general, most kids really want to do their best, and what may appear
as laziness or apathy, may be frustration. Individuals with these issues often
suffer from low self-esteem, because it seems that the harder they try,
the less they get accomplished. Depression and anxiety often accompany
ADHD and other learning problems, but can also mimic ADHD.

ADHD and learning disabilities cannot be diagnosed with a simple
behavior checklist or a one hour interview with a psychologist or
psychiatrist. ADHD in particular can mimic mood or behavioral disorders. 
Thorough testing has to be conducted to determine if the person really has ADHD, 
to what degree, and identify the areas of functioning that are affected. In addition, other
learning disabilities, such as reading, math, or auditory processing
problems, co-occur in 70% of the individuals who have ADHD.  It is
important to determine where the thinking process is inefficient so
that the right course of treatment can be recommended. Stimulant
medications are appropriate for individuals who truly have ADHD as they
generally increase the ability to focus. However, they do not "fix"
other issues in executive functioning, such as planning and decision making. 
Strategies often need to be learned to help the work round these other issues. 
Testing plays a key role in identifying a person’s strengths, as
well as their weaknesses, so that they may learn skills in order to
succeed in school and in life. If the problem is not ADHD, but anxiety
or depression, different medications and treatment options would be
recommended. In the case of other learning disorders, stimulant medications would not be 
useful, but tutoring and cognitive rehabilitation in areas of weakness can make a huge impact.


**It is important to note that most insurances do not pay for learning disability testing, though they may pay for ADHD testing.**

Testing is offered for teens 12 and older, including adults. If you or your teen has a learning problem, 
the information you would learn through testing would be invaluable
to you. Even if your child has been tested in elementary school, their brains have developed more 
since then, especially if they received tutoring. For High School Seniors and college students, such testing 
is required in order to obtain assistance from college Learning Centers. On their website, The Georgia
Board of Regents states what documentation is required for a college student to receive additional time
for tests, tutoring, and other accommodations needed to optimize learning. Testing must be
current, within 3 years.
