 Dr. Lacy offers a variety of assessments for a wide range of problems.  Her primary specialty is in neuropsychology, the study of the relationship between the brain and behavior. Conditions that would fall under the category of neuropsychology include: brain injury, stroke, tumors, seizures, hydrocephalus, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, learning disabilities, ADHD, dementia, and other neurological conditions.  Services provided include neuropsychological testing, education, and cognitive rehabilitation to improve thinking skills.
 
Dr. Lacy is an Aviation Psychologist. Pilots are often referred by the FAA for neuropsychological testing, which may range from a simple interview and Cogscreen-AE evaluation to a full neuropsychological battery. Dr. Lacy is trained in Cogscreen-AE administration and interpretation. All FAA referrals, including evaluations for the HIMS treatment program, are accepted. 

Baseline Assessment Program (BAP) assessments for the NFL Concussion Settlement are provided by Dr. Lacy. The Baseline Assessment Program manages scheduling the neuropsychological assessment in these cases. 

Psychological testing is also offered, including “fitness for duty” evaluations, military evaluations, adoptions, and personality assessments as an adjunct to psychotherapy.  Individuals can be referred by other psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, physicians, adoption agencies, or employment agencies for psychological testing.

Chronic pain evaluations and brief psychotherapy are offered for patients who are seeking surgical interventions for pain relief.  Patients with chronic headaches, back pain, orthopedic pain, and nerve pain can receive brief therapy to learn pain management techniques.  Though your pain is real and physical, psychological factors play a key role in your tolerance for pain and level of daily functioning.  Psychological testing is  provided as part of the pre-surgical screening required by insurance companies for spinal cord stimulators and intrathecal morphine pumps.

Dr. Lacy strives to provide accurate and objective assessments, as well as practical recommendations to help patients receive the best treatment possible.
