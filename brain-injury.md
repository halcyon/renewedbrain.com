Brain injury can occur during an automobile accident, work related accident, military combat, sports concussion, 
or any kind of trauma to the head. When brain injuries occur because of an outside force, it is often referred 
to as Traumatic Brain Injury. Brain injuries also result from events such as strokes, aneurysms, seizures, tumor,
brain surgery, hydrocephalus, infections, toxic exposure, substance abuse, and lack of oxygen to the brain. These 
types of events are usually referred to as Acquired Brain Injuries.

Brain injuries affect people in various ways, depending on the location and severity of the injury. A patient may 
or may not have lost consciousness or been in a coma, but noticeable changes in a person’s thinking skills and 
personality after suffering a brain injury can occur. Changes can be noticed by family members,even when the 
patient does not recognize any problems with their thinking.

Common symptoms of brain injury include problems with:

* memory

* attention and concentration

* speech or language skills 

* reading, math, or academics 

* decision making and problem solving 

* motivation and initiation

* low tolerance for frustration with anger outbursts

* driving skills and other complex activities

* depression, anxiety and other changes in mood 

* changes in personality

* headaches and seizures

* changes in sleeping and eating habits

It is crucial to have brain injuries evaluated through neuropsychological testing.   The brain often 
does not heal 100%, and we cannot determine which problems will remain in any given individual. 
We can see where a person's functioning is now and track progress over time. The brain usually 
does the most healing in the first two years after injury. That is the time to begin cognitive 
rehabilitation in order to learn new ways of doing things. Testing identifies those areas of thinking that need treatment. Neuropsychological testing is often recommended sometime within the first 6 months after injury 
(if possible), and is often repeated at the 1 year and 2 year marks to document the patient’s 
progress and residual deficits.

Testing also helps determine if a person is able to return to work or school, and identify any 
accomodations that need to be in place to help them succeed.

### What is neuropsychological testing?

Neuropsychological testing helps us to understand how the brain is functioning. CT and MRI scans 
usually can identify if there are structural changes in the brain. These are ordered by neurologists 
and physicians. Though usefull, such scans cannot describe how well a person's brain is functioning. 
Neuropsychological evaluations are pencil and paper tasks or computer assessments that challenge 
a person’s abilities in all areas of thinking. Neuropsychological testing is more thorough than 
psychological or even psychoeducational testing in that it goes beyond assessing personality, 
intelligence and academic functioning to include all areas of cognitive functioning.

### Is neuropsychological testing right for you?

We often receive calls from people stating they have been diagnosed with four or five different diagnoses, 
and they are understandably confused. Neuropsychological testing helps to clarify the issues underlying 
the patient's problems, whether it is  related to injuries or diseases of the brain, medication side 
effects, medical problems, chronic pain factors, or emotional issues. You do not need a referral for 
neuropsychological testing, unless your insurance requires it, such as with Tricare. 

### What does neuropsychological testing involve?

Testing usually takes 4-6 hours, sometimes more, depending on the issue. The first hour is an interview 
with the patient and any family  members that may be ableto provide additional information about the patient’s 
history. You will be asked extensive questions about your symptoms, medical history, psychiatric and 
social history. The remainder of the day will be spent testing the various functions of
the brain through different kinds of tasks to see how well you perform. Once testing is completed, 
the tests are scored, interpreted, combined with any available medical records, and integrated into a 
detailed report that can be shared with your physicians or school. Feedback sessions are provided 
usually two weeks after testing.
